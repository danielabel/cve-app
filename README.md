# CVE-APP

A demo application to provide CVE summaries

## Structure
The app is made of up two partsi.

- A react frontend app - `web-app`
- A Java/Springboot service - `cve-app-service`

Each has a README that details how to run them, and how they were built.

## How to run

1. Start the [Service](cve-app-service/README.md)
2. Start the [web app](web-app/README.md)
3. open a browser to point to http://localhost:3000/


## What's missing
Each of the app's READMEs have sections on what's not been done, and what could be done next.

Thinking broadly - a key gap I'd want to fill, if there was more time, would to have a single script to build, test, 
package, and run the application. I started looking at using 
[gradle mutli-project builds](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html) 
and [a Gradle node plug in](https://github.com/srs/gradle-node-plugin) but ran out of time. 

The second gap I'd like to fill would be a browser or full integration test. Each app tests itself in
isolation, relying on a manual check for a full integrated pass. I'd probably use 
[Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) for this.
