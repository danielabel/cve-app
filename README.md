# CVE-APP

A demo application to provide CVE summaries

## Structure
The app is made of up two parts each has a read me describes them 
and how to run 

1. A react frontend app - `web-app`
2. A Java/Springboot service - `cve-app-service`

## How to run

1. Start the [Service](cve-app-service/README.md)
2. Start the [web app](cve-app-service/README.md)
3. open a browser to point to http://localhost:3000/


## What's missing
Each of the READMEs have sections on what's not been done, but the 
key gap I'd like to do is get a gradle script to build, test and 
package up the applicaion to into one JAR that could be run from 
a single command to run the app.
