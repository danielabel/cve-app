# Dan Abel's CVE summary web app

## Technologies used 

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock)

## How to run the app

This project was generated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I'm not totally a fan, but it seems to be a standard, so I've left most patterns and tech in place,
for ease of use / context.

It's been built and tested with Node v14.15 but any modern version should be fine.

`npm start` Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser if if doesn't open it for you.

Oh, you'll want to `npm install` before you run it.

`npm test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

There is a `npm run build` command from Create React App, but I've not used it.

## Narration

### What do we have?
React isn't my usual ballpark for the last few years, so I've tried to pick a simple set of libraries to get me going.

I've avoided React classes in favour of functions aimed for `Props` rather than `State` where ever possible.
I've tried to keep it simple and avoided more advanced tooling and options that would suit a bigger app.

#### Test Design

I use stubbed data in my data fetching tests. I like to not rely on other code bases and have have fast tests.
This does create a gap in the tested expectations
I rely on manually testing the app in integration. In a real situation, I might consider some browser based testing. 

In a real world app I likely would have some more tests - here I've given a sample to get it
done and shipped.

### What's not ideal

#### Test locations

Create-React-App and jest seem to want to focus tests in to the `src` directory and
near the files under test. I prefer a sibling `test` folder to a `src` folder, but I've gone with the
built-in standard here.

### What's not been done
- I want to add a spinner to let the user know the search is happening
- I've relied on bootstrap for all styling and defaulted to what's easily available in react-bootstrap - it could probably benefit from better use of that too :)
- There's no use of routing (react-router etc ) to change the URL to reflect the state in the URL
- I'd like to improve the navigation when there's a api call error
- [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) looks cool, I'd like to see if it simplifies and improves the app.
