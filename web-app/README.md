##Technologies used
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## How to run the app

This project was generated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I'm not totally a fan, but it seems to be a standard, so I've left most patterns and tech in place,
for ease of use / context.

It's been built and tested with Node v14.15 but any modern version should be fine.

`npm start` Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser if if doesn't open it for you.
Oh, you'll want to `npm install` before you run it.

`npm test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

There is a `npm run build` command from Create React App, but I've not used it.
