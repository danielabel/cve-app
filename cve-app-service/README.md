# CVE-APP Service - a service to provide data for a demo application to provide CVE summaries


## Data sources 
This service pulls results from the nvd.nist.gov database of CVEs 

The API used returns results in batches, ordered by most recent filtered by keyword provoded

## Operating

This service is a java-15 spring-boot service

Build and test: `./gradlew build` 

Run it: `./gradlew bootRun`

## Technologies used 
- gradle
- java 15
- spring-boot - web app container / runner
- junit 5 - unit test framework 
- hoverfly-java - http stub for independent component testing
- jackson + JsonPath for JSON manipulation 

## Would have loved to use
- checkstyle
- spring-boot 

## Design thoughts /  Principles applied
 - Outside in / 'service as unit' testing - using a stub to not
   rely on an external resource to allow tet automation to run
 - avoids strongly coupling to the external API in the code - take what's needed
   without describing or coupling to anything  we don't. 
-  Also avoiding making the external domain the domain of the app

## Narration
1. Used MockMvc as a lightweight way of testing the web app
2. Looked at using `gson` but moved to using `` and JsonPath as it made things simpler
3. After experimenting I favoured `RestTemplate` over `WebClient` in this app for simplicity / easy of use 



## to be done
1. Handle errors in controller - network and parse (and test!)
2. build upstream url better
3. use map/ streams / or better loops
4. break up the code into domain parts
5. test missing items in getters - whappens if one item in array does not have data (need to fiddle with input data)
   

## Nice to have
0. should use builders to generate test data - both in and outx
1. Speed up tests - memory settings
2. validate that there is not a lightweight way to use Jackson
3. can I exclude jackson from my dependencies fully
4. checkstyle or similar linter
5. consider better processing of json (gson?)
