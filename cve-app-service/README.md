# CVE-APP Service - a service to provide data for a demo application to provide CVE summaries

This service is a java-15 spring-boot service

## Technologies used 
 - gradle
 - java 15
 - junit 5 - unit test framework
 - spring-boot - web app container / runner
 - gson - to process JSON
 - hoverfly-java - http stub for independent component testing

##  Principles applied
 - Outside in / 'service as unit' testing

## Narration 
1. Selected gson as a simple modern tool to process json.
2. Used MockMvc as a lightweight way of testing the web app  



## to be done
1. Handle errors in controller - network and parse

## Nice to have

1. Speed up tests - memory settings
2. validate that there is not a lightweight way to use Jackson
3. can I exclude jackson from my dependencies fully
4. checkstyle or similar linter
